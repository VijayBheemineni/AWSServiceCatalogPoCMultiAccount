# AWS Service Catalog Multi-Account Solution

A Terraform-based solution for managing AWS Service Catalog portfolios and products across multiple AWS accounts using a hub-and-spoke architecture.

## Overview

This solution enables centralized management of AWS resources through Service Catalog, allowing teams to provision standardized resources (like S3 buckets) across multiple AWS accounts with consistent naming, tagging, and security configurations.


Note :- This is a PoC implemented by me to use GitHub and deploy ServiceCatalog products to multiple AWS accounts.
